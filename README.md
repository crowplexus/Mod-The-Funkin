little fnf godot thing extremely work in progress rn

made just for fun and not really meant to be used in a serious modding environment

but if you're gonna use this on a mod keep in mind that it wasn't really built for that, it was built to just be a personal engine because fnf weekend update doesn't actually work on my computer without stuttering inconsistently every 5 seconds during a song

### Timed Events are very basic event types that contain a [code]time[/code]
### field, which is used to trigger the event during gameplay.
class_name TimedEvent
extends Resource

## Name of the event (as an identifier).
@export var name: StringName
## Time (in seconds).
@export var time: float
## Function to run when the event loads.
@export var eload: Callable
## Function to run whenever the event gets fired.
@export var efire: Callable
## Internal values in the event.
@export var values: Dictionary = {}
## Internal value, indicates that the event has already been fired, so no point in doing it again.
var was_fired: bool = false

func _to_string() -> String:
	return "[%s, %s, %s]" % [ name, time, values ]

### Returns a Velocity Change event.
static func velocity_change(_time: float, speed: float = 1.0) -> TimedEvent:
	var vc: = TimedEvent.new()
	vc.name = &"Scroll Speed Change"
	vc.time = _time
	vc.values.speed = speed
	return vc

### Returns a BPM Change event.
#static func bpm_change(_time: float, bpm: float = 100.0) -> TimedEvent:
#	var vc: = TimedEvent.new()
#	vc.name = &"BPM Change"
#	vc.time = _time
#	vc.values.bpm = bpm
#	vc.efire = func() -> int:
#		Conductor.bpm = vc.values.bpm
#		return vc.values.bpm
#	return vc
